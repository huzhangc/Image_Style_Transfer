# Image_Style_Transfer
DS301_Final_Project

## Project Description
Image style transfer is a technique that preserves the content of an image while applying the style of another image onto it. This method relies on a neural network to learn the features that capture the style and content of the input images, which are then used to create a new image that merges the content of one image with the style of the other.

In this project, we aim to examine and evaluate 2 popular algorithms of image style transfer:
* Neural Style Transfer
* Real-time Style Transfer

## Code Structure
This repo contains the 2 google colab notebook, and we suggesting using GPU to execute those notebooks.
* Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb
* Real_Time_Transfer.ipynb

Those two notebooks are originally run on Colab so some path should be adjust if you want to run it locally.
Images required to run those two notebooks are included in the images folders in this repo.

## Evaluation
